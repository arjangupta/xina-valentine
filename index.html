            <h2>
              Happy Valentine's Day, my love! I love you so, so much. Thank you for everything you do for me. You are a wonderful wife, and
              a fantastic mom. The kids don't know how good they have it with you! On the other hand, I do know how great I have it with
              you, and I never take it for granted. I would crumble to pieces without you, my life would be nothing!
            </h2>
            <h2>
              I love our marriage and I couldn't ask for a better life. You do so many things to make our life happy and loving, and I want
              you to know that I really appreciate all of it. You always listen to my rants (even when they are boring!), you buy me lots of treats (like Andy's!!), you help me
              achieve everything I try to achieve (my workouts, hobbies, Master's work), and many other loving things. I couldn't ask for a better partner.
            </h2>
            <h2>
              We are going to have such an excellent year ahead. Now that Sanya is growing up, we're able to do so many more things (especially compared
              to last year). I am really looking forward to going to Germany with you two. Ich liebe dich!
            </h2>
            <h2>
              Every day I look forward to seeing you. When you are around, everything is alright. My favorite thing is cuddle times with you. I love
              that you like watching The Last of Us with me! I love that we go on more dates now. Thanks for giving me this great life, and thanks for being an awesome wife!! You're the bestest!!! 
            </h2>
